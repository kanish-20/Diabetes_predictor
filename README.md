# Diabetes Prediction using Flask & Decision Tree

This is a simple web application that predicts whether a person is diabetic based on input health metrics like Glucose, BMI, Insulin, and Age. The backend is powered by a Decision Tree Classifier and the frontend is built using HTML and styled with CSS.

## Features

- Predict diabetes based on 4 key medical inputs
- Built with Python, Flask, and Scikit-learn
- Simple and clean user interface
- Model trained on PIMA Indians Diabetes dataset

## How It Works

The app uses a Decision Tree Classifier trained on real-world data from diabetes.csv

When a user submits their Glucose, BMI, Insulin, and Age:

The model predicts whether the person is Diabetic or Not Diabetic

The app displays the prediction result instantly on the same page
